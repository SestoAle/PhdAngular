After establishing a connection with other approaches (benchmarking, stochastic analysis, etc.), the \"real-time\" perspective to the management of uncertainties will be illustrated. We will review the main techniques to analyze and design real-time systems. Finally, we will illustrate what the real-time research can offer to the recent challenges in cloud computing, IoT and cyber-physical systems.",

In particular we look at the foundations of such techniques among which various kinds of Markov chains and related probabilistic and stochastic process algebras for the modelling of systems, and to probabilistic and stochastic temporal logics for the specification of properties. Furthermore, the basic probabilistic and stochastic model-checking algorithms will be illustrated. Hands-on experience will be provided by performing smaller case studies in modelling and verification using the state-of-the-art PRISM model checker. Some lectures will be dedicated to illustrate more advanced recent developments and perspectives for future research in this field in particular in relation to the modelling and verification of smart and collective systems.",
